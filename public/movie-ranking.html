<hr />
<h3>Saint Maud (2019)</h3>
<p>Totally engrossing psychological horror, with all the elements that perfectly toy with your darkest emotions. 
    As I was watching it, I remembered some important work to do but its radiancy was such that I just couldn't leave it. 
    The main character's persona spiraling down into a delusionary state was both unnerving and devastating to watch. 
    This movie clearly brings out the horrors of being alone and the frantic attempt to find a meaning for their life. 
    How religiously delirious one can become just to garner some attention and lead a life with supposed "meaning" can be seen in a frightening way through this film. 
    Humans are social animals and if left alone, their own power of imagination and consciousness can turn up against them. 
    This movie brings out the pain of people suffering from PTSD and how they dearly need one's support. 
    The movie is perfectly directed and edited with some really powerful scenes. I am just glad that I watched it.</p>
<h3>The Iceman (2012)</h3>
<p>I watched this movie as I was looking for something with cold and grim overtones and who can be better than Michael Shannon for such roles. 
    The plot was average and direction was mediocre with some very effective scenes. 
    Basically, Michael carries the whole movie on his shoulders. 
    It's his amazing performance that propels this movie.
     The thing that i liked the most was the character of Chris Evans.</p>
<h3>The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)</h3>
<p>One of the finest thrillers i have ever seen. 
    Thinking about Ripley's persona alone gives me goosebumps.</p>
